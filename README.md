App name: Travel Journal

App description: The app provides a space whereby a person can record their travel memories in an easy to use format. After logging-in the user can see all of their travel posts showing the countries and cities they have visited. Each of these posts can then be further accessed to see all of the details, includung their journal notes.

Reason for app: I have always loved travelling and i love to record my memories from a trip in a journal to complie at home with pictures and souveniers. The app is the first step in allowing to do this in my phone without the need for a physical journal.

Attributions:
  - notes from the GA unit 2 course were vital in building the app (https://generalassembly.instructure.com/login/canvas)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/ I used stack overflow to research how to add and change the format of the date in the Schema.
  - https://discourse.getgrav.org/ I used discourse to reseach how to add and format the logo image into the <nav>.

Technologies used: JavaScript, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, CSS

Next steps:
  - I would like to be able to add pictures to the journal posts as well being able to share them in some sort of newsfeed (homepage) whereby the differnet users could interact with each others posts.
